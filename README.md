## Start of the development
Everything started when we didn't have Internet. We decided to make a small game, and I made a simple prototype. Then, we decided that game should be in #-style (lol).   
After that, I started implementing backend stack. Then, I added multiplayer, and we started polishing frontend stack.
## Backend
Backend is written on JS, and uses Express and ws. Node serves static content, which is bad, bud we didn't even had a choice.
## Frontend
Frontend is written on HTML/CSS/JS, which makes it very messy. Kilometers of shitcode lol
